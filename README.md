## Sales Prediction with Advertising Media Analysis 

**Project Overview**

This repository provides code for predicting sales using machine learning, considering the impact of advertising media (TV, radio, newspaper) on sales performance. It analyzes advertising expenditures and other factors to help businesses optimize their advertising strategies.

**Key Features**

* Sales prediction using machine learning algorithms.
* Feature engineering for incorporating advertising media ratios.
* Model training and evaluation with Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* Baseline model comparison to assess advertising data impact.
* Model optimization using GridSearchCV (demonstrated with Random Forest).
* Feature importance analysis (applicable to Random Forest).
* Sales prediction for new data points.
* Visualization options for feature importance and actual vs. predicted sales (optional).
* Saving the best model for future predictions (optional).

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* sklearn (including train_test_split, StandardScaler, linear_model, ensemble, svm, metrics, GridSearchCV)
* matplotlib
* seaborn (optional, for visualization)
* joblib (optional, for saving the model)

**Running the Script**

1. Replace `"Sales.csv"` in the code with the path to your sales data CSV file.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script: `python sales_prediction.py`

**Output**

* The script will print the MSE for each model and the optimized Random Forest model's hyperparameters.
* Feature importance scores and visualizations (optional) will be displayed if the optimized model is a Random Forest.
* The predicted sales value for the provided new data point will be printed.

**Further Exploration**

* Experiment with different machine learning algorithms.
* Try additional feature engineering techniques.
* Implement other optimization methods beyond GridSearchCV.
* Explore more advanced visualization techniques.
* Integrate the model into a web application or production environment for real-time predictions.
